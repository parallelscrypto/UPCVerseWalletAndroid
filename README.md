*Mission: Harness the existing UPC Grid Infastructure to provide high value quality entertainment for the vehicle (and home) \n 
*Each UPC code is a UNIQUE Metaverse server!  {{hack}} it, {{pwn}} it, and then {{upload}} your [[intelligence]]\n 
*Perfect for TRUCKERS, indie journalists, indie artists, organizations seeking donations,indie actors/acrtesses, and Sovereign individuals who are sick of Big Tech/Corporations snooping around in our data, running our lives and PWNING our data. \n 
*Get paid on YOUR terms by SELLING YOUR [[intelligence]] as a UPC NFT and accept MATIC DIRECTLY to YOUR UPC code! \n 
*Every day new UPCs are declared as `coinboxes`.  First x number of users with Leveled Up Scanners can grab free coins from the coinboxes. \n *Every day, the default UPC [[777777777777]] is updated. Check back Often!  This is your Self Owned Shared Crypto News and Intelligence Platform built on a fully decentralized stack (IPFS, POLYGON, UPC Codes) \n 
*Record a video or take a pic and upload to [["+this.state.account+"]]! \n 
*Each UPC has a default VR zone.  Just type the `vr` command! * \n 
*Mirror (xvr) your centralized censroable videos to the UPCs, and upload (xpayload) them for safekeeping \n  

*Each UPC Code can be bought and sold for around 1 MATIC

* Initially, 100 Trillion Keyz tokens (0xb1B6415b23a40a75b913faBAA1505503BD49eCf3) were minted. Proof [https://polygonscan.com/token/0xb1B6415b23a40a75b913faBAA1505503BD49eCf3]. Each token provides one unit of utility.  Each Keyz token can be used to tokenize 1 upc code.  
* When a user tokenizes a UPC code (ie. the user has successfully executed the {{hack}} and {{pwn}} commands on the previously unowned UPC MicroServer that they have scanned), they are the owner of the server.  A server has a front stage, a back stage, and all sorts of metadata inside of it.  The user who owns the UPC code (a UPC Developer!) can program the UPC code, and then easily express the resource as a UPCScript!  One use case is for a homeless person, but any person can be substituted.  The scenerio is that the user found an interesting product package and they want to tokenize the UPC [[766868331174]].  Next, they scan, {{hack}} and {{pwn}} the microserver. they would be able to upload a single video about (possibly) street life or whatever else they desire.  They can then {{flip}} the UPC NFT in our decentralized marketplace, and instantly (as soon as there is a buyer) get  paid!

*    Any human with an Anddroid phone can access any UPC server by simply scanning it.
